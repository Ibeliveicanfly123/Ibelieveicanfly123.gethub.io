        SIGCSE stands as a notable institution, yet its methods for accepting or declining proposals for their annual technical symposium lack consistency. Dr. Nicki Washington's article highlights the added challenges faced by individuals outside the conventional spectrum, particularly Black women, in getting their proposals endorsed. She dissects various aspects of the feedback she received, which fail to align logically with the guidelines provided. In the “Relevance and Interest” segment, one reviewer displays blatant inconsistency, contradicting themselves shortly after expressing an inability to evaluate the panel's relevance; another critique questions the community benefit aspect, which was adequately addressed in the proposal. Moreover, the reviewers exhibit a bias towards tenure-track faculty with PhDs, implying a lack of technical depth among non-tenure-track panelists. However, the panel in question centered on identity-inclusive computing, with panelists chosen to represent diverse voices in K-16 education. This critique overlooks the fact that tenure-track faculty might not be the most suitable spokespersons for K-12 education. Additionally, lacking a PhD does not diminish one's qualifications in discussing computing or education. While citations were not mandatory, Dr. Washington's proposal was penalized for having only one. Her citation of bell hooks’ <em>Teaching to Transgress</em>, the inspiration behind the panel, is entirely justified, especially considering the absence of citation requirements. Overall, the reviewers seem to expect Dr. Washington's team to surpass stated requirements, while disregarding crucial aspects of the proposal. When evaluating submissions for inclusion, it is imperative to maintain uniform standards and refrain from arbitrary discrepancies in acceptance criteria.

        The approval of proposals that fail to meet these undisclosed criteria suggests discriminatory practices in SIGCSE's panel selection process.
